# Reddit API Data Analysis Application - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A comprehensive data analysis application that interfaces with Reddit's API to collect, process, analyze, and visualize Reddit data for insights and trends.

## Core Features & Requirements

### Reddit API Integration
- OAuth 2.0 authentication for Reddit API access
- Data collection from subreddits, posts, comments, and user profiles
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Data validation and integrity checks

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Text processing and sentiment analysis
- Metrics calculation and aggregation
- Machine learning and NLP capabilities

### Data Storage & Management
- PostgreSQL database for structured data
- Redis for caching and queue management
- Configurable data retention policies
- Automated backup systems

### Visualization & Reporting
- Interactive dashboards with real-time metrics
- Customizable charts and graphs
- Automated report generation
- Export capabilities (PDF, CSV, JSON)

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Package Manager**: uv (ultra-fast Python package installer)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Queue System**: Celery/Redis
- **Frontend**: React.js with Chart.js/D3.js
- **API Client**: PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- **Analytics**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK/spaCy
- **Deployment**: systemd services with virtual environments

## Development Phases

This project is divided into 6 phases, each with detailed specifications:

### [Phase 1: Foundation](./phase_1_foundation.md) (Weeks 1-2)
Project setup, environment configuration, Reddit API authentication, database design, and basic data collection setup.

### [Phase 2: Data Collection](./phase_2_data_collection.md) (Weeks 3-4)
Comprehensive Reddit API client implementation, data collection pipeline with rate limiting, validation, and background processing.

### [Phase 3: Data Processing & Analysis](./phase_3_data_processing.md) (Weeks 5-6)
Text processing, sentiment analysis, statistical analysis modules, machine learning models, and metrics calculation.

### [Phase 4: Visualization & API](./phase_4_visualization.md) (Weeks 7-8)
REST API development, dashboard creation, interactive charts, filtering capabilities, and report generation.

### [Phase 5: Advanced Features](./phase_5_advanced_features.md) (Weeks 9-10)
Advanced analytics, real-time streaming, custom workflows, user management, and sharing capabilities.

### [Phase 6: Polish & Deployment](./phase_6_deployment.md) (Weeks 11-12)
Performance optimization, security hardening, documentation, deployment setup, and user acceptance testing.

## Success Metrics
- Successfully collect data from 10+ subreddits
- Process 10,000+ posts and comments daily
- Generate insights with 95% accuracy
- Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- API response time under 500ms
- 99% uptime for data collection

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Rate Limits**: Exponential backoff and request queuing
- **Data Volume**: Pagination and incremental updates
- **Reddit API Changes**: Abstraction layer for API interactions
- **Performance**: Caching and database optimization
- **Security**: OAuth best practices and secure API keys

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time alerting system
- Multi-platform support (Twitter, Discord)
- Advanced ML models for content recommendation
- Mobile application
- Enterprise features (SSO, advanced permissions)
